/* Global replacement of operators new and delete.
 *
 * By linking this file into a binary we globally replace new & delete.
 *
 * This allows us to track how much memory has been allocated from C++ code,
 * both in total and per ep-engine instance, by allowing interested parties to
 * register hook functions for new and delete.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * Link this file into /all/ binaries (executables, shared libraries and DLLs)
 * for which you want to have memory tracking for C++ allocations.
 *
 * (Note: On most *ix-like platforms (Linux and OS X tested), it is sufficient
 *        to link this file into the main executable (e.g. `memcached`) and
 *        all shared libraries and dlopen'ed plugins will use these functions
 *        automagically. However this isn't the case on Windows/MSVC, where you
 *        need to link into all binaries for the overrider to take effect.
 *
 * Implementation:
 *
 * According to the C++11 spec
 * (http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/new/operator_new#Global_replacements),
 * overriding base `operator new` and `operator delete` /should/ be sufficient
 * to all C++ allocations, however this isn't true on Windows/MSVC, where we
 * also need to override the array forms.
